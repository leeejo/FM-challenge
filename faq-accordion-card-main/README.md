## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this FAQ accordion card and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
Bonus: Complete the challenge without using JavaScript
Want some support on the challenge? Join our Slack community and ask questions in the #help channel.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript


### What I learned

Use grids when you need to section things out without worrying it about them "moving" around or breaking the grid.
CSS accordion is cool but too much css code to deal with.
Adding the vector into the code is out of my knowledge.

I am not able to do toggle (click on the same open content to toggle visibility) using pure css. If anyone knows how, please teach me.
